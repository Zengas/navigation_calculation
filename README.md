# üß≠ Navigation Calculation Suite üåç

A personal Python-based project designed to support navigation calculation tasks, originally created as part of my studies for the Portuguese recreational boating license *Patr√£o de Alto Mar* (Ocean Skipper), which is the highest recreational license one can obtain in Portugal. The suite provides a reliable set of tools to calculate positions, headings, distances, and great circle routes.

## ‚öì Overview

This project helps sailors, navigators, and enthusiasts perform practical maritime navigation calculations using an intuitive desktop interface.

## üì¶ Modules

### Rhumb Line Module
- Compute direct and inverse rhumb line solutions (loxodromes).
- Determine headings and arrival positions.

### Arrival Point Module
- Compute final position given a starting coordinate point, distance traveled, and azimuth taken.

### Great Circle Module
- Calculate orthodromic (great circle) distances and course angles.
- Generate segmented waypoints with azimuths (up to 100 segments).

### Heading & Distance Module
- Compute azimuth and rhumb line distance between two points.
- Includes graphical visualization of headings.

## ‚úÖ Instructions
- Download the zip and unpack everything into a folder.
- Run the navigational_suite.py and follow the instructions, they are self-explanatory.
